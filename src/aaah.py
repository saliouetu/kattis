def aaah(jonah, doctorah):
    """
    Determine whether Jonah can say "aaah" long enough for the doctor.

    The doctor requires a certain length of "aaah" (represented by the 
    number of 'a' characters). Jonah succeeds if his "aaah" has at least 
    as many 'a's as the doctor's.

    Parameters
    ----------
    jonah : str
        The string representing Jonah's "aaah".
    doctorah : str
        The string representing the doctor's required "aaah".

    Returns
    -------
    str
        "go" if Jonah's "aaah" is long enough, otherwise "no".

    Examples
    --------
    >>> aaah("aaah", "ah")
    'go'
    >>> aaah("aaah", "aaaaah")
    'no'
